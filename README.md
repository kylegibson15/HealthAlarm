## The Goal

#### The goal of this application is to help users who struggle to start their days off on the right foot. They plan to but get stuck in bed when the alarm goes off in the morning.
#### HealthAlarm will give users an easy way to wake up with one step actions to starting their day.
#### You can also have a conversation with HealthAlarm as you wake up to check your progress.

## Purpose of this UI

#### The purpose of this frontend is to allow you to sign-up/login and give the application permission to read your Apple Health Data. This is a Read-Only application, it will not add any new information to your Apple Health Data.

#### Your Apple Health Data will be sent to a database that the Google Assistant application with have reading rights connected by your email address.

## Future Integrations

#### Many users may not own a Google Home, so I will be adding a feature to incorporate Google Assistant into this frontend application.
##### This way you will be able to access the Health Alarm Google Assistant Application right from your device.

#### I also want to add functionality for Android users by building a Google Fit integration.
